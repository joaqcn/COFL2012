# COFL2012
COFL2012 is a software tool to estimate carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations at roadway intersections. It was developed by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) and University of Central Florida.

## Overview
COFL2012 allows users to model CO concentrations for different roadway configurations:
  - 4x4 intersection
  - 4x6 intersection
  - 6x4 intersection
  - 6x6 intersection
  - East Tee intersection
  - South Tee intersection
  - West Tee intersection
  - North Tee intersection
  - Freeway tollbooth
  - E-W freeway diamond
  - N-S freeway diamond
The user inputs information about traffic volumes, speeds, and roadway geometry. COFL2012 then runs the CAL3QHC air dispersion model to estimate CO concentrations at receptor locations around the intersection.

COFL2012 outputs the estimated 1-hour and 8-hour CO concentrations, which can be compared to National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
